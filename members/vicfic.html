            I've been fascinated by computers since I was a child. It was mostly video games, yes
            but unlike other human inventions, computers took our most lethel weapon - our intelligence,
            and made it better.

        <p>I got interested in Linux due to my Raspberry Pi, which came with a version of debian.
            One thing led to another and after a couple of years I ended up on Arch Linux.
            My current setup involves Arch with the GNOME Desktop environment, and Hyprland as
            an alternative windows manager when I work intensly with terminals.
