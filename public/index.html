        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
            We are a proud group of intellectuals who understand that Free and
            Opensource software is the only way to make humanity progress.
            Installing and using a GNU/Linux Operating system is key to getting started
            with the free software lifestyle. We believe in creating and nurturing this
            hacker culture, and its necessity in rejuvenating the computer geek spirit.
        </p> <br>

        <h3>Why Linux? </h3>
        <p>
            The primary thing that keeps students away from fiddling and hacking around
            with computers is the rise of the dumb "consumer friendly" operating systems.
            Windows and Mac OS, despite making computing more accessible to all, also
            closed down their systems, which prevents the users from accessing the true
            power of their computers. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using GNU/Linux will lead you down a path in which you will truly understand
            how the computer works and what it is truly capable of.
        </p> <br>

        <h3>How Do I Join?</h3>
        <p>
            We have only one requirement for being a member of the LUG, that is to
            install and use a distribution of GNU/Linux as your primary Operating
            System. You are not barred from using other OSs, but your primary one
            should be GNU/Linux. If you are already on GNU/Linux, please contact any
            existing members of the LUG, we shall verify and add you into the group!
        </p>
